* A script is composed to create the tables together with their constraints and then ingest data into them.

* The following queries are then composed to extract data:
1. Find the family and given names of academics who have authored at least one paper with the word “database” in the paper’s title.
2. Find the family and given names of academics who are working for the “University of Canberra” who have not authored any paper.
3. Find the total number of academics who have an interest in 'databases'.
4. Find the field number of the most popular field(s).
5. Find the family and given names of the academics who are interested in the most popular field(s).
6. Find the number of papers authored by each academic.
7. Find the family and given names of the academics who are interested in less than 2 fields.
